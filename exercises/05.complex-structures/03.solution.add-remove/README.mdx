# Add / Remove Items

👨‍💼 Hooray, we've got a great solution for adding multiple images to our notes.
Users are going to love this feature.

💯 Did you take the time to think about the screen reader experience of our "❌"
and "➕ Image" buttons? You can use `sr-only` and `aria-hidden` to visually
hide/show different elements for screen readers. So here's how it was
implemented in my solution:

<details>
<summary>Spoiler alert!</summary>

```tsx start=181 lines=185-186
<button
	className="text-foreground-destructive absolute right-0 top-0"
	{...list.remove(fields.images.name, { index })}
>
	<span aria-hidden>❌</span>{' '}
	<span className="sr-only">Remove image {index + 1}</span>
</button>
```

```tsx start=193 lines=197
<Button
	className="mt-3"
	{...list.insert(fields.images.name, { defaultValue: {} })}
>
	<span aria-hidden>➕ Image</span> <span className="sr-only">Add image</span>
</Button>
```

</details>

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a new <LinkToApp to="/signup" /> route and link to it from
the <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> file for the next exercise. It'll just be
a form that takes an "email" input. Feel free to put that together if you have
extra time, or you can <DiffLink>check my work</DiffLink>.
