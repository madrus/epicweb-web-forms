# Changelog

This file will keep track of significant changes that have happened in the
workshop material that is different from what you'll see in the videos.

## DataFunctionArgs

`DataFunctionArgs` was deprecated in Remix and will be removed in the future. It
is recommended to use `LoaderFunctionArgs` and `ActionFunctionArgs` instead
which are the exact same.
