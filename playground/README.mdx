# Disable Default Validation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/professional-web-forms/form-validation/dynamic-error-validation-with-hooks" />

👨‍💼 Now that we have nice looking error messages we manage ourselves, we want to
disable the built-in browser errors because they go counter to our design
aesthetic.

But we don't want to disable them completely, just once our JavaScript has
loaded to enhance the user experience. Until that time, the browser's built-in
client-side validation is ok. So, we'll use a little trick to disable them only
after our React app has hydrated:

```tsx
function useHydrated() {
	const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false)
	useEffect(() => setHydrated(true), [])
	return hydrated
}
```

We effectively only need to assign the return value of that hook to the
`noValidate` prop of our form and we're good to go.
