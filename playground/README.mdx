# Field Labels

## My Notes

Accessibility of inputs requires them to be coupled with the corresponding inputs like this:

```tsx
<div>
	<label htmlFor="color">Favorite Color</label>
	<input id="color" type="text" />
</div>
```

We can test out whether our label and input are correctly coupled by clicking on the label text above the input.
If the input is focused, then you've done it! If not, then there's still more work to do. :smile:

A nice piece of information is that React has an ID-generation util: `useId()` that can be used to generate
unique IDs on the fly. But there is more to this. It is the hydration consistency between the client and server.
E.g. we cannot use `Math.random()` as an id because the server will generate a different random number
than the client. That is why we use React's `useId` hook, which will keep it consistent both on the server render
as well as on the client render. So we can refresh, and I get the same thing, both server and client.
The way that ends up looking is this really funky-looking Id. But it doesn't actually matter.

Another issue we've got is the `Reset` button doesn't work. This is because, due to styling requirements,
our `Reset` button is outside of the `<form>` element. So we need to communicate to the browser
that the `Reset` button is associated with the form. Similar to how you associate labels and inputs,
we use IDs. We can do this by adding a form attribute to the button:

```tsx
<button form="form-id" type="reset">
	Reset
</button>
```

We already do this with our submit button (otherwise it wouldn't work).

üë®‚Äçüíº We need to update the accessibility of our note edit form. The current
implementation is not accessible because the `<label>` and the `<input />` are
not associated with each other. So it should be something like this:

```tsx
<div>
	<label htmlFor="color">Favorite Color</label>
	<input id="color" type="text" />
</div>
```

You can test out whether your changes fixed the problem by clicking on the label
text above the input. If the input is focused, then you've done it! If not,
then there's still more work to do.

Another issue we've got is the "Reset" button doesn't work. This is because, due
to styling requirements, our Reset button is outside of the `<form>` element.
So we need to communicate to the browser that the Reset button is associated
with the form. Similar to how you associate labels and inputs, we use IDs. We
can do this by adding a `form` attribute to the button:

```tsx
<button form="form-id" type="reset">
	Reset
</button>
```

We already do this with our submit button (otherwise it wouldn't work), so you
can use that as a reference.

Please find Kody in <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx" />
and make sure the label and input have an association via the `id` and `htmlFor`
props and the reset and submit buttons are properly associated to the form via
the `id` and `form` props.
