# Disable Default Validation

## My Notes

We want to disable the default browser validation for our form only when the component is mounted (hydrated).
For that we create a hook `useHydrated` that checks if the component is mounted and use this hook in our form:

```tsx
const isHydrated = useHydrated()
```

> The idea behind this is that React hooks don't run on the server. So, as long as the component is not mounted,
> the hook will return `false`.

Now we can disable the default browser validation when the component is mounted:

```tsx
<Form noValidate={isHydrated} />
```

If the user is on a really slow network connection or the JavaScript fails to load for some reason,
then we can get the client-side validation that's built into the browser automatically as well.
So we have those options and can give the user a nice user experience there.
If that were to fail somehow or sometimes there's some validation logic that requires the server
like username must be unique, then our server-side validation will still catch.
But the benefit of doing this is it means that if the users on a really slow Network connection,
we don't want to make them have to do a full network request at that moment to determine if the username is unique.
Even to determent if the title was required or the title was too long or whatever.
That is why let's do all the validation on the client that we can while we are not hydrated.
In the case that the users got a really slow network connection, we can also even if we are hydrated
and it would be nice to have some client-side validation for some of this stuff to to not waste network traffic.
We are going to implement some of that in the future as well.

👨‍💼 Now that we have nice looking error messages we manage ourselves, we want to
disable the built-in browser errors because they go counter to our design
aesthetic.

But we don't want to disable them completely, just once our JavaScript has
loaded to enhance the user experience. Until that time, the browser's built-in
client-side validation is ok. So, we'll use a little trick to disable them only
after our React app has hydrated:

```tsx
function useHydrated() {
	const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false)
	useEffect(() => setHydrated(true), [])
	return hydrated
}
```

We effectively only need to assign the return value of that hook to the
`noValidate` prop of our form and we're good to go.
