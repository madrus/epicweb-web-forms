# Form Validation

## My Notes

We can use the MDN [📜 Form Validation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
to validate the form. For that we just add validation attributes as necessary. Here are they:

- **required**: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.
- **minlength and maxlength**: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).
- **min and max**: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.
- **type**: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.
- **pattern**: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.

We can also use CSS pseudo classes like `:valid` and `:invalid` to visually highlight
the valid and invalid fields.

Then our code may look like this:

```tsx
<Input name="title" defaultValue={data.note.title} required maxLength={100} />
```

👨‍💼 One cool thing about our users is we can trust them so we don't need to do
validation...

😂 Just kidding. In fact, even if you do trust your users we should be doing
validation. It's about a better user experience!

Here are the requirements:

- `title` is required, maximum length of 100
- `content` is required, maximum length of 10000

You can use native HTML form validation attributes on the `input` and `textarea`
to accomplish this. `required`, and `maxlength` are the attributes
you'll need.
