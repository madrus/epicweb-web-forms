# Focus Management

## My Notes

> **KCD**
> We can include the whole `actionData` as a dependency, not just `actionData?.status`
> because if the status changes the whole actionData object will change anyway
>
> Form elements same as divs and spans are not focusable unless we add a `tabIndex``
of negative 1: `tabIndex={-1}`. A negative index does not allow user to tab focus
> on the element but it allows us to programmatically do that.
>
> When the form gets focus because of an error, the first time you tab again, you will
> be focused on the first error field.

üë®‚Äçüíº A lot of what we do for accessibility in the web is manage the user's
keyboard focus. It can be really annoying if I click a "submit" button, and then
I have to find the field that caused the error I'm seeing. Wouldn't it be nice
if the focus moved to the field that has an error?

And what if there are two fields with an error? I think it would be best to
focus on the first one.

And what if the entire form has an error? Well, we should probably focus on the
form itself and the screen reader will announce the user the issue with the
form.

So that's what I'd like you to do next. This is the perfect use case for
`useEffect`, but don't worry, the dependency list here is going to be quite
simple.

	While we're at it, let's add `autoFocus` to the `title` field, so folks can
	start typing right away.
