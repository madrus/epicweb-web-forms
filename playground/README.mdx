# Zod schema validation

🧝‍♂️ BTW, I swapped your `useEffect` for a custom `useFocusInvalid` hook, just so
you know.

👨‍💼 Let's make our validation better and more declarative. Prepare to delete a
lot of code!

One important thing you'll want to know is how Zod manages errors. When you use
`zodSchema.parse`, it will throw an error if the data is invalid. If you use
`zodSchema.safeParse`, it will return an object with a `success` property that
tells you whether the data is valid or not. If it's not valid, it will also
have an `error` property that contains the error object. If it is valid, it
will have a `data` property that contains the parsed data.

The [Error Handling](https://zod.dev/ERROR_HANDLING) docs can be quite helpful.
You'll definitely want to use
[`.flatten`](https://zod.dev/ERROR_HANDLING?id=flattening-errors) for this one:

```tsx
if (!result.success) {
	console.log(result.error.flatten())
}
/*
  {
    formErrors: [],
    fieldErrors: {
      name: ['Expected string, received null'],
      contactInfo: ['Invalid email']
    },
  }
*/
```

That shape may look a little familiar 😅

That should be enough to get you going.
