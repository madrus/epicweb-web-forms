# Disable Default Validation

## My Notes

We want to disable the default browser validation for our form only when the component is mounted (hydrated).
For that we create a hook `useHydrated` that checks if the component is mounted and use this hook in our form:

```tsx
const isHydrated = useHydrated()
```

> The idea behind this is that React hooks don't run on the server. So, as long as the component is not mounted,
> the hook will return `false`.

Now we can disable the default browser validation when the component is mounted:

```tsx
<Form noValidate={isHydrated} />
```

👨‍💼 Now that we have nice looking error messages we manage ourselves, we want to
disable the built-in browser errors because they go counter to our design
aesthetic.

But we don't want to disable them completely, just once our JavaScript has
loaded to enhance the user experience. Until that time, the browser's built-in
client-side validation is ok. So, we'll use a little trick to disable them only
after our React app has hydrated:

```tsx
function useHydrated() {
	const [hydrated, setHydrated] = useState(false)
	useEffect(() => setHydrated(true), [])
	return hydrated
}
```

We effectively only need to assign the return value of that hook to the
`noValidate` prop of our form and we're good to go.
